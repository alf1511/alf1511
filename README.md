## 💼 Portofolio

### 🔧 Data Engineering Portofolio
- [JKT48's YouTube Video Comments to PostgreSQL](https://github.com/alf1511/jkt48_yt_to_datawarehouse) <br>
  Built a data pipeline using Apache Airflow to automate data ingestion from YouTube to an S3 bucket as a data lake, and finally to PostgreSQL as a data warehouse. The data used in this work is about the JKT48's videos information.
  
- [New York Housing Market ETL](https://www.notion.so/New-York-Housing-Market-ETL-6f70b4097fd24b3a97aab7077de07590) <br>
  Developed an ETL process to extract New York Housing Market data (from local to Google Cloud Storage), transform it to several fact and dimension tables (using MageAI in Google Cloud's VM Instance), and load it into a data warehouse (Google's Big Query).


### 📊 Machine Learning Portofolio

- [Human vs Horse](https://github.com/alf1511/Human-vs-Horse-Image-Recognition)  
  This project's primary objective revolves around the development of a sophisticated model capable of accurately classifying images of humans and horses using CNN. Primarily used tools are TensorFlow and Python.

- [Generating Poem Text](https://github.com/alf1511/LSTM-Generating-Poem-Texts)
  This project centers around the prediction of generating a poetic sentence. The model is constructed using the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture. Primarily used tools are TensorFlow and Python.

### 📈 System Development Portofolio

- **AI Visual Inspection System**  
  Led the development of a visual inspection system using machine learning to improve quality control in the one of the bigest automotive industry in Indonesia. The project involved **image processing**, **deep learning models**,and **software engineering**. The model used in this project is YOLOv8.
- [Restaurant Management System MVC using Java](https://github.com/alf1511/Restaurant-Management-System-MVC)
  This project is based on a desktop application built using the Java programming language and using the MySQL database. This application is a simple management application for ordering food.
- [Travel Mates](https://github.com/alf1511/TravelMates)
  This is an application created to complete the final project of the Software Engineering course. This application is a recommendation app for tourist destinations based on a specific budget input. The app is built using the Django framework. The code in this repository is not complete; it only consists of the authorization process in the application.
